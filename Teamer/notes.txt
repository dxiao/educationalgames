What are we trying to solve here?


Learning @ Scale

Need people to learn software engineering principles
2 Phase game
Possible extensions larger phases


Have a demo - three functions leading to the next capstone

Poster idea - sequence 

[] Add confirmation that people are ready for the next stage


3/14

put function signatures in sidebar
arranging by function
mechanism for reviewing problems

sort reviews by +1/0/-1?
also disply explicit +1/0/-1

bring out problem statement
bring functions screen all way to bottom

allow solutions to change in 2?

don't let Bob see Alice's reviews on Bob's code
